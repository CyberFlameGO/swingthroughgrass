## 💻 Installing
If you don't want to compile the plugin yourself, you can grab a ready production build from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/swingthroughgrass.100067/)! After downloading, simply drop the .JAR to your `plugins` directory.

Otherwise, run the `package` Maven task, and then simply put the compiled output into the `plugins` folder in the root directory of your Spigot server.

## ⏪ Compatibility
SwingThroughGrass is compatible with Minecraft versions 1.14 and up (as defined by the `api-version` setting in `plugin.yml`). Compatibility with 1.13.x may be possible by changing the api-version property and the Spigot API Maven dependency.
